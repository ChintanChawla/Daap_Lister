       "<tr><td>UMA - Universal Market Access</td><td>Closed</td><td>UMA is designed to power the financial innovations made possible by permissionless, public blockchains, like Ethereum. Using concepts borrowed from fiat financial derivatives, UMA defines an open-source protocol that allows any two counterparties to design and create their own financial contracts. But unlike traditional derivatives, UMA contracts are secured with economic incentives alone, making them self-enforcing and universally accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>0x16Ed0fe6952DAB8Bb1f1c1dD132A24d15b094419</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">2</td><td>0xcc0C1A655C87752Ab57859c3A161770fC99cE4C3,0x7EE6B6F29705eBD6bf4480F26DC2BFc1841Cdb5f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",
